## 9. Recommendations

### ✅ For CI/CD (Use Mock Server)

**Status**: READY FOR PRODUCTION

- Comprehensive endpoint coverage (39/39)
- Fast execution (2-5 seconds)
- Zero external dependencies
- Deterministic results
- Perfect for PR validation

**Recommendation**: USE IN CI/CD - Verified with real Anki

### ✅ For Local Development

**Status**: READY

Use either:
1. **Mock server** (default): Fast, no setup required
2. **Real Anki** (optional): For full behavior verification

**To test with real Anki**:
```bash
ANKI_CONNECT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765 bun test
```

### ⚠️ For Advanced Testing

**Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

Consider adding:
1. Performance benchmarks
2. Concurrency tests
3. Error injection tests
4. Real scheduling verification
5. Add-on compatibility tests
