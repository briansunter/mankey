## Key Findings Summary

### Raindrop-MCP Model

- **Package name:** @briansunter/raindrop-mcp (scoped)
- **Distribution:** npm, npx, bunx, global install, local
- **Entry point:** src/index.ts with shebang and proper error handling
- **Build output:** Executable binary + TypeScript definitions
- **Publishing:** Automated via semantic-release on git push
- **Testing:** Bun test framework with 80% coverage requirement
- **Versioning:** Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)

### Critical for Mankey-MCP

1. Add package.json fields: "types", "publishConfig"
2. Update build script: include chmod +x
3. Add "prepublishOnly" hook
4. Ensure shebang in src/index.ts
5. Update tsconfig.json: declaration, declarationMap, sourceMap
6. Create .npmignore file
7. Setup GitHub workflows
8. Configure NPM_TOKEN secret

## Key Takeaways

### What Makes Raindrop-MCP Production-Ready

1. **Complete package.json** with all required fields
2. **Automated publishing** via semantic-release
3. **Comprehensive CI/CD** with validation at each step
