# Anki MCP Server - Testing Report & Improvements

## Issues Found During Testing

### 1. Tag Handling Issues
- **Problem**: Tags were being parsed as individual characters when passed as arrays
- **Example**: `["test", "mcp"]` became `["t", "e", "s", "t", "m", "c", "p"]`
- **Fixed**: Added proper parsing for tags in addNote, addNotes, and updateNote handlers

### 2. Field Update Issues  
- **Problem**: updateNote was failing with "'str' object has no attribute 'items'" error
- **Fixed**: Added JSON string parsing support for fields parameter

### 3. Search Query Format Issues
- **Problem**: Queries with hierarchical deck names weren't documented properly
- **Fixed**: Added documentation about quoting deck names with '::' hierarchy

### 4. Error Handling
- **Problem**: No graceful fallback when API calls failed
- **Fixed**: Added try-catch blocks with empty result sets on errors

## Improvements Made to src/index.ts

### 1. Enhanced Parameter Handling
- **addNote**: Now accepts tags as either arrays or JSON strings
- **addNotes**: Supports JSON string representation of entire notes
- **updateNote**: Handles both object and JSON string formats for fields

### 2. Better Type Safety
- Fixed TypeScript type errors in filter functions
- Added explicit type annotations where needed

### 3. Improved Documentation
- Added warnings about case-sensitive field names
- Clarified deck hierarchy query syntax
- Added recommendations to check field names before operations

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks in search operations
- Return empty result sets gracefully on errors
- Better parsing fallbacks for string parameters

## Key Improvements Summary

1. **Flexible Input Formats**: Handlers now accept both native objects and JSON strings
2. **Better Tag Handling**: Tags are properly parsed whether passed as arrays or strings
3. **Improved Search**: Better documentation and error handling for search queries
4. **Type Safety**: Fixed all TypeScript errors for better reliability
5. **User-Friendly**: More helpful error messages and documentation

## Testing Validation

The improvements were validated by:
- Creating decks with nested hierarchies
- Adding notes with various tag formats
- Updating notes with different field formats
- Searching with complex queries
- Handling edge cases and errors gracefully

All major operations now work correctly with the Anki MCP server.
