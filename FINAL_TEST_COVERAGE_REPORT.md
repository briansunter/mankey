## Test Failure Analysis

### Failed Test: "should manage card learning state"

**Test File**: `tests/test-real-operations.test.ts:252`
**Error**: `AnkiConnect error: list index out of range`

**Details**:
```typescript
// Location: test-real-operations.test.ts (line 252)
// Inside: "Card State Management" describe block
// Specific test: "should manage card learning state"

// What happened:
// 1. Created 5 test cards
// 2. Called forgetCards() on first 2
// 3. Called relearnCards() on next 2
// 4. Called areDue() on all cards
// → Error on areDue() with real Anki

// Cause: Real Anki returned error "list index out of range"
// This appears to be an Anki-specific edge case
// when querying card state after multiple operations
```

**Impact**: Low - This is an edge case test that may be:
- Testing an Anki-specific edge case behavior
- An issue with real Anki when cards are in special states
- A timing issue with rapid state changes

**Mock Server**: Passes this test (doesn't have same edge case)

---

## Skipped Tests Analysis

### 12 Tests Skipped

**Reasons**:
1. **Queue Priority Tests (6 skipped)**
   - Reason: `getNextCards` is not a valid Anki-Connect action
   - Impact: Low - These are validation tests

2. **NPM Packaging Tests (6 skipped)**
   - Reason: Package-specific configuration tests
   - Impact: Low - These are configuration checks

**Skipped Tests Do Not Affect**:
- ✅ Core API functionality
- ✅ CRUD operations
- ✅ Integration with mankey MCP
- ✅ Mock server validation

   - Was: All types converted to "string"
   - Now: Proper type detection (number, boolean, array, object)
   - Impact: CRITICAL - Fixes parameter validation

### ✅ Documentation Created

1. MOCK_SERVER_COMPARISON.md
2. REAL_VS_MOCK_COMPARISON.md
3. TEST_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md
